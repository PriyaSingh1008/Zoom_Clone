Built with the latest Next.js and TypeScript, this project replicates Zoom, a widely used video conferencing tool. It enables users to securely log in, create meetings and access various meeting functionalities such as recording, screen sharing, and managing participants.

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
